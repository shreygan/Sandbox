### What will my application do?
The goal for my project is to create a 2d sandbox environment.
For example, I want to be able to create shapes and objects in the window,
where the objects will fall and bounce according to their characteristics.
In addition to objects interacting with the "ground" and "walls" of the sandbox,
I want to the objects to also be able to interact with each other in a realistic
manner.

### Why does this project interest me?
This project interests me because initially I wanted to create a game of some sort,
but I settled on this project as it provides a level of freedom for the user 
in how they interact
with the program.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add any number of circles to the sandbox while the simulation is running
- As a user, I want the circles to initially move in random directions, but still fall with gravity and bounce off all the boundaries of the sandbox
- As a user, I want to be able to pause and play the simulation
- As a user, I want to be able to delete all circles in the sandbox, or relaunch all of them again in random directions


- As a user, I want to be able to save the current state of the sandbox
- As a user, I want to be able to load a sandbox from a file
